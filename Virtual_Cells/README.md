Only the 'one_per_bag_combined' folder was added in Github, as they are the final files used to calibrate the Virtual tumor (See '3_Virtual_Tumor_Calibrations.R').

Running the script '1_1_Virtual_Cells_Generation' and '1_2_Rearrange_VC_files' will generate much more subfolders and files used during the project, 
notably the root RxODE/PaSM outputs used to generate the files in 'one_per_bag_combined'. However, these 'source' files are very voluminous and not suitable for being dropped in GitHub.
